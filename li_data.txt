I bet you smiled when you saw my name pop up on your phone just now. *monkey covering eyes emoji* 🙈
I can’t see you right now, but I bet you look great. *heart*❤️
Can I save you in my phone as “future loml”? 👀
Can you send me a selfie? I just want to show my mom what my future partner looks like. 😛
Do you have a name you want me to save you as in my phone or should I just put “mine”? 🤙
So I already got your number, what’s next? 😉
Let’s play iPhone games! If I win, you take me out. If you win, I will take you out. 🏆🤳
Well, I texted you. What are your other two wishes? 🧞
So aside from taking my breath away, what do you do for a living?❓
I’d like to take you to the movies, but they don’t let you bring the heroine. 💃
I believe in following my dreams. Can I have your Instagram? 😛
Is it just the profile pic? Or am I totally feeling captured.
Do you believe in love at first text, or should I text you again?
Are you a smiley 😉? Because you make me smile.
I tried to send you something flirty, but I couldn’t fit in the text box?
I had to remove my space bar so I could get closer to you? 🤗
Greetings and salutations. I guarantee you, I’m not flirting with you. I’m just being extra nice to someone who’s extra attractive.👌
Roses are red, my face is too… that only happens when I see you. 😉
I like you like I like my coffee. Constantly inside me. ☕
*Crystal ball emoji*🔮 I see me in your future.
I am picky at taste, but you are yummmm. 😛
I’m a zombie, shall I eat you out?‍♂️
Are you Dracula? You looked a little thirsty when you were looking at me. 🧛🏻
If you were a flower, you’d be a damn-delion. 🌷

You must be the guy who’s going to buy me a drink.
Hey, please keep your distance. I might fall for you any time.
Hey, can I take a screenshot of our call duration with you? I just want to make my ex jealous.
I am not quite certain what you think of me. I just hope it’s at least R-rated.
You are hotter than a sunburn.
Your lips are kind of wrinkled. Mind if I press them?
I can see into the future, and yeah, it’s me and you with our kids.
My mic is wet, I kissed you so much?
You make me melt like an ice cream cone under the summer sun.
Do you want to go half on a baby?
Are you doing my math homework? You seem hard and ready to be done on my desk.
I might not be going downtown later, but hopefully, I’ll be going down on you.
Start printing out those missing person posters. I’m gonna have you tied up in my room for a long time.
If I told you that I work for a delivery service company, would you let me handle your package?
I want to go on an ‘ate’ with you. No worries, you can give me the ‘D’ later.
What is: b l u e?  BLUE, Then I love you!
My phone’s battery is fully charged can we use it by talking online
I thought phone calls were just for talking, but I can show you some exceptional communication skills too. (Begin a sex talk)
I can Turn You On, despite the fact that we are (kilometers) away!
Now I know why someone invented the telephone! So that we can talk.
You know what’s best ? Your voice is this sweetest and I am not diabetic.
Are you talking or is a Nightingale singing?
What’s the time? Oh that’s when I was supposed to  give you a kiss .
You know what the cost of my phone is? It’s priceless because it lets me hear your voice.
If you can talk to me all night, I wouldn’t mind being a statue.
You seem like a hard worker. I’ve got an opening you can fill.
I may not be Wilma Flintstone, but I can make your bedrock.
You’re like hot chocolate and I’m like marshmallows. You’re hot and I want to be on top of you.
Your lips are meant to be kissed. Let’s not waste them.
Are you wearing space pants? Because your butt is out of this world.
“Roses are red, violets are blue. I like spaghetti, let’s go screw.”
Your breasts remind me of Mount Rushmore — my face should be among them.
I’m not a dentist, but I bet I could give you a filling.
Stop, drop, and roll, baby. You are on fire.
I hear you’re looking for a stud. Well, I’ve got the STD and all I need is you.
I’m not into watching sunsets, but I’d love to see you go down.
The condom in my pocket expires tomorrow, so why don’t you help me use it?
Let’s play carpenter! First, we’ll get hammered, then I’ll nail you.
Is it a haunted house? Because I want to make sure you scream loud, when I am with you.
I have 206 bones in my body. Want to give me another one?
Did you sit in a pile of sugar? ‘Cause you have a pretty sweet ass!
You’re so hot, my zipper is falling for you.
I’m not a weatherman, but you can expect a few more inches tonight.
Can you take oﬀ your clothes so I can see where you hide your angel wings?
You’re so hot, my zipper is falling for you.
Just checked my battery life, it’s at 69%.
Can we have my thingy on your thingy?
What’s your favorite flavor? I am going to buy a packet of condoms.
You feel so soft, and I’m really hard.
